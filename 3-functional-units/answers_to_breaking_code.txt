multiplier_iterative_v2.v:
line 27: added brackets to make product wrong


multiplier_iterative_tb.v:
line 63: moved assert(a*b == r) to out of repeat loop and changed $fatal(Product is wrong) to $display(Product is right).


multiplier_pipelined_tb.v
line 7: Removed localparam keyword from STEPS
line 45: Added random "$finish"

multiplier_pipelined_v2.v
line 21: changed always_ff (@posedge clk) to always_comb
line 22: changed inputs from <= assignment to = assignment

register_file_tb_simple.v
line 59: changed assert to read_data_a == 0
line 73: changed assert to read_data_a == 0

register_file_v0.v
line 30: changed condition to reset != 1

Solution notes:
Removing localparam keyword from steps seems to have no impact on the running of the pipeline testbench.
Using an integer seems to let the test-bench run in fundemantally the same way.
THe difference is that localparams cannot be modified after declaration.
